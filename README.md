## GPLA-12
Public Dataset
-------
GPLA-12 is a new acoustic leakage dataset of gas pipelines involving 12 categories over 684 training/testing acoustic signals. We collect acoustic leakage signals on the basis of an intact gas pipe system with external artificial leakages, and then preprocess the collected data with structured tailoring which are turned into GPLA-12. GPLA-12 dedicates to serve as a feature learning dataset for time-series tasks and classifications.  

The data_v1 is the first edition data set.  
The data_v2 is the second edition data set.  

At present, the data set has been updated to the third version. Please download the data_v3 if necessary.
